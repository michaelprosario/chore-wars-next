# Chore Wars - Refined Requirements

## Core Philosophy
Keep it **simple, visual, and fun**. Focus on instant gratification and friendly competition. Avoid overwhelming users with complexity.

---

## 1. Essential Game Mechanics (Keep It Simple)

**XP & Leveling**
- Every chore = XP points (simple scale: 10-500)
- Clear visual progress bar to next level
- Satisfying "LEVEL UP!" animation when you advance

**Gold Currency**
- Earn gold alongside XP
- Used to "purchase" real-world rewards from DM

**Random Loot Drops** (Fun, not functional)
- 20% chance of finding silly virtual items
- Examples: "Crusty Sponge," "Lost TV Remote," "Mysterious Sock"
- Purely for laughs and the activity feed

---

## 2. The Quest Board (Dead Simple Task List)

**Three Quest Types:**
- **One-Time Quests** - Do once, disappears
- **Daily Quests** - Resets every day (e.g., "Make your bed")
- **Weekly Quests** - Resets weekly (e.g., "Mow lawn")

**Visual Clarity:**
- Color-coded difficulty: 🟢 Easy | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 Hard
- Big "CLAIM QUEST" button (prevents double-work)
- Big "COMPLETE!" button when done

---

## 3. Party & Competition (The Fun Part)

**Your Party Dashboard:**
- See everyone's current level and avatar
- Weekly leaderboard (resets Monday)
- Activity feed with flavor text:
  - *"Alex vanquished THE OVERFLOWING TRASH!"*
  - *"Sam found a Mysterious Sock while doing laundry"*

**Optional Boss Battles:**
- Household goal (e.g., "Defeat the Spring Cleaning Dragon")
- Requires combined 5,000 XP from everyone
- Unlocks group reward when beaten

---

## 4. Rewards (Real World Connection)

**The Reward Shop:**
- DM creates custom rewards with gold costs
  - Examples: "Pick the movie" (50g), "Sleep in Saturday" (200g), "Pizza night" (500g)
- Players "purchase" rewards by spending gold
- DM approves and deducts gold with a memo note

---

## 5. The Dungeon Master (Simple Admin)

**DM Powers:**
- Create/edit/delete quests
- Set XP and gold values
- Approve completed quests (anti-cheat verification)
- Manage the reward shop
- Adjust player gold/XP if needed (with visible memo)

**Verification Flow:**
1. Player clicks "Complete Quest"
2. DM gets notification
3. DM clicks ✓ to approve or ✗ to reject
4. Player gets rewards immediately upon approval

---

## 6. What to Leave Out (Simplicity!)

**Don't include:**
- ~~Complex stat systems (Strength, Intelligence, etc.)~~ - Too complicated
- ~~Equipment/gear systems~~ - Feature creep
- ~~In-game currency store~~ - Real rewards only
- ~~Chat features~~ - Just use the activity feed

---

## Key User Experience Principles

1. **Mobile-first** - Everyone has their phone
2. **Big buttons** - Easy to tap "Claim" and "Complete"
3. **Instant feedback** - Animations, sounds, celebration
4. **Visual progress** - Always show how close you are to leveling up
5. **Friction-free** - Complete a chore in 2 taps (Claim → Complete)

---

## Recommended Platform Features

- **Clean, colorful interface** (think Habitica meets Sweepy)
- **Push notifications** when quests are available
- **Weekly recap email** - "You earned 450 XP this week!"
- **Avatar customization** - Simple visual identity for each player

---

This keeps the system **fun and sustainable** without becoming a second job to manage. The focus stays on motivation, not micromanagement.
